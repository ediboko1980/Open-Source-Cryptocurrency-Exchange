### Introduction 
This branch is a fork of Peatio that will provide an open source cryptocurrency exchange platform that uses 0xBitcoin (https://0xbitcoin.org/) as the default base currency.

0xbitcoin-exchange focuses on 0xbitcoin support and user friendly, non-geeky trading experience.

The exchange in http://0xbitcoin.exchange (not live, sorry folks) is community-based, non-corporate one and it proceedings will support promotion and adoption of 0xBitcoin.

~ 0xBitcoin combines groundbreaking features of Bitcoin with capabilities of Ethereum ~
